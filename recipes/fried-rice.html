                <ol>
                    <li>If you are making sauce to go along with it, make the sauce. If not, ignore this.</li>
                    <li>Cook your vegetables and meat <strong>together</strong> over high heat. Don't forget the peanut 
                    oil unless you want to do a Superman impression prying the food off the pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook the meat until it's well done, then transfer it to a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add enough oil to cook the veggies until they're crisp - drop them in the same bowl as the meat.</li>
                    <li>Scramble the eggs.</li>
                    <li>Cook the rice until it's golden-brown. Mmm, tasty...</li>
                    <li>Dump everything in the skillet, cook it some more, and serve it hot and fresh. <em>Bon appétit!</em></li>
                </ol>
